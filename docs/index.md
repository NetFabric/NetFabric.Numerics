# NetFabric.Numerics

Welcome to the documentation for **NetFabric.Numerics**, a powerful C# library that provides strongly-typed implementations of multiple coordinate systems, including rectangular, polar, spherical, and geodetic. Whether you're working with angles, points, or geographic coordinates, this library has you covered!

> **Note:** The `NetFabric.Numerics` library utilizes advanced generic math features, which are only available in .NET 7 and C# 11. 
> Make sure you are using a compatible version of the framework before using this library.

## Installation

To get started with **NetFabric.Numerics**, you need to install the library's NuGet packages. The library is divided into three packages, each serving a specific purpose:

- [NetFabric.Numerics.Angle](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetFabric.Numerics.Angle/): Provides strongly-typed angle implementations.
- [NetFabric.Numerics](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetFabric.Numerics/): Provides strongly-typed rectangular 2D and 3D, polar, and spherical coordinate system implementations.
- [NetFabric.Numerics.Geography](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NetFabric.Numerics.Geography/): Provides strongly-typed geodetic coordinate implementations.

Make sure to include the appropriate package(s) in your project, depending on your specific needs.
